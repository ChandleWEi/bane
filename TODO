- Dynamically create new behaviors like "SlowResponseForEachLine" by using Module.const_missing
- Use ActiveSupport or other extensions for time durations (seconds, minutes, etc.)
- Allow passing in modules directly to the launcher for simpler script/test access
- Create the script-mode usage which can take a hash of behaviors and options
- Pick an open source license (BSD? Apache 2? CC?)

Ideas:
- Use some dynamic class creation using const_missing -- "xyzForEachLine" which wraps the
  given behavior with a while(io.gets) {} block.
