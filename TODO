- Clean up Configuration class
  - remove duplication

- Use ActiveSupport or other extensions for time durations (seconds, minutes, etc.)
- Allow passing in modules directly to the launcher for simpler script/test access
- Create the script-mode usage which can take a hash of behaviors and options
