- Allow behavior options to be passed in the Hash-based configuration mode
- Speed up 'defaults' integration test to use something other than a timeout test, which is quite slow
- Rectify the Configuration/ConfigurationParser split -- Remove some duplication / clarify the ConfigurationParser class as needed
- Dynamically create new behaviors like "SlowResponseForEachLine" by using Module.const_missing
- Log every request to the server/behavior, in addition to open, close
- Use ActiveSupport or other extensions for time durations (seconds, minutes, etc.)
- Pick an open source license (BSD? Apache 2? CC?)

Ideas:
- Make the Launcher use a Factory to create the server given a dependency, rather than depending directly on the
  DelegatingGServer class.  This would make it possible to swap the base server implementation more easily.
