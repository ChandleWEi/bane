Refactor:
- Decide if the current behaviors should be tied more directly to DelegatingGServer, via subclassing or some other way.
- Figure out where the logger configuration logic belongs in the Launcher/DelegatingGServer relationship
- Deprecate the Configuration() method and create a few ConfigurationParser strategies rather than trying to be so flexible
- Should the default logger go to STDERR or STDOUT?

Remaining:
- Write the bad TCP/IP behaviors - using something like C/C++.
- Write the remaining bad HTTP behaviors.  In addition, we may want to replace the NaiveHttpResponse with something
  from the standard Ruby library, so that there's less code in this project, and so we know that we're
  following the HTTP protocol.

Ideas:
- Make the Launcher use a Factory to create the server given a dependency, rather than depending directly on the
  DelegatingGServer class.  This would make it possible to swap the base server implementation more easily.
- Use ActiveSupport or create simple extensions for time durations (seconds, minutes, etc.)
- Dynamically create new behaviors like "SlowResponseForEachLine" by using Module.const_missing (this is only
  applicable for some behaviors)
- Log every request to the server/behavior, in addition to open, close.  For this to work, it would have to be the
  behavior's responsibility, since GServer#serve gets called only once for the lifetime of the connection.
