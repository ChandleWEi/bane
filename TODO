Features:
- Allow Bane to listen on all addresses (0.0.0.0) rather than default local-only (127.0.0.1)
- Quieter exits on Ctrl-C (than plain stack trace)

Design questions:
- Is there a natural separation in Configuration between parsing arguments and instantiating/finding behaviors?
- Explore the ServiceRegistry usage -- should "find" behaviors be there? Printing?
- Decide if the current behaviors should be tied more directly to BehaviorServer, via subclassing or some other way.
- Figure out where the logger configuration logic belongs in the Launcher/BehaviorServer relationship
- Should the default logger go to STDERR or STDOUT?
- Break the Behaviors out into several files and test files?

Future Behaviors:
- Create a more configurable version of the DelugeResponse which allows for a header, footer, content and times to repeat.
- Write the remaining bad HTTP behaviors.  In addition, we may want to replace the NaiveHttpResponse with something
  from the standard Ruby library, so that there's less code in this project, and so we know that we're
  following the HTTP protocol.

Ideas:
- Use ActiveSupport or create simple extensions for time durations (seconds, minutes, etc.)
- Dynamically create new behaviors like "SlowResponseForEachLine" by using Module.const_missing (this is only
  applicable for some behaviors)
- Log every request to the server/behavior, in addition to open, close.  For this to work, it would have to be the
  behavior's responsibility, since GServer#serve gets called only once for the lifetime of the connection.


Current Task:
- Make options be passed into constructor of Behavior classes instead of through BehaviorServer (middleman smell)
- Create new examples (make host have a default?)
- Document new way to programmatically create behaviors in README (as a list of BehaviorServers)
- Change or delete integration tests to have one CLI configuration happy path?
- Add a deprecation warning to the Configuration() method
- Delete old examples
- Bump version (to 0.3.0)
- Release new gem
