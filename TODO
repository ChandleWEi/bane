- Rectify the Configuration/ConfigurationParser split -- Remove some duplication / clarify the ConfigurationParser class as needed
- Dynamically create new behaviors like "SlowResponseForEachLine" by using Module.const_missing
- Log every request to the server/behavior, in addition to open, close
- Use ActiveSupport or other extensions for time durations (seconds, minutes, etc.)

Ideas:
- Make the Launcher use a Factory to create the server given a dependency, rather than depending directly on the
  DelegatingGServer class.  This would make it possible to swap the base server implementation more easily.
