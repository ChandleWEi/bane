From "Release It!" p. 126 ("Test Harness"):

"... the socket connection is succeptible to the following failures:

* It can be refused.

* It can sit in a listen queue until the caller times out.

* The remote end can reply with a SYN/ACK and then never send any data.

* The remote end can send nothing but RESET packets.

* The remote end can report a full receive window and never drain the data.

* The connection can be established, but the remote end never sends a byte of data.

* The connection can be established, but packets could be lost causing retransmit delays

* The connection can be established, but the remote end never acknowledges receiving a packet, causing endless retransmits

* The service can accept a request, send response headers (supposing HTTP), and ndever send the response body.

* The service can send one byte of the response every thirty seconds.

* The service can send a response of HTML instead of the expected XML.

* The service can send megabytes when kilobytes are expected.

* The service can refuse all authentication credentials.

The failures fall into distinct categories: network transport problems, network protocol problems, application protocol problems, and application logic problems. ..."


Other behavior listed (p. 128):

"Many kinds of bad behavior will be similar for different applications and protocols.  For example, refusing connections, connecting slowly, and accepting requests without reply would apply to any socket protocol: HTTP, RMI, or RPC."

"... accept connections but never reply..."
"... gets a connection and a reply, but the reply is from /dev/random ..."
"... open a connection and then drop it immediately ..."
